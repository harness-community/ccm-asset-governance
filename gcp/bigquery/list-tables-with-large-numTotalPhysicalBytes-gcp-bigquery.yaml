# Identifies BigQuery tables consuming large amounts of physical storage (> 1 GB).
# Large tables may include old, redundant, or unused data that can be pruned.
# Archiving or deleting old partitions can reduce long-term storage and backup costs.

# This rule helps flag tables that are candidates for optimization to control data storage expenses.
