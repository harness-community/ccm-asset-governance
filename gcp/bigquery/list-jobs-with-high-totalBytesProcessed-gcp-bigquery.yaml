# Detects BigQuery jobs that process a large volume of data (> 1 GB), which can lead to higher query costs.
# Optimizing such queries with filters (WHERE clauses), partitioned tables, or selective column usage can reduce scanned data.
# Reducing totalBytesProcessed improves performance and minimizes cost per query.

# Refer to BigQuery cost optimization best practices: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/best-practices-costs
