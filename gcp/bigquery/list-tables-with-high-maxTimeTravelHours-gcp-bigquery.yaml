# Identifies BigQuery tables with a high maxTimeTravelHours setting, which controls how far back in time a table's state can be restored.
# The default time travel window is 168 hours (7 days), the minimum allowed is 48 hours.
# Time travel enables querying a table's previous state, which increases storage and snapshot retention costs.
# Reducing this window to 48 hours can lower storage and snapshot-related costs, especially for frequently updated tables.

# Example usage of time travel query:
# SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.table` FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR);
