# Notebooks with large storage allocations may be over-provisioned, unused, or holding outdated data.
# Cleaning up these volumes or resizing them can help reduce storage costs and improve efficiency.
# It's advisable to implement lifecycle configurations to clean up local disks on notebook shutdown.
