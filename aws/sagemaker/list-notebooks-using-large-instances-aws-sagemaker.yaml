# Identifies AWS SageMaker notebook instances using large or high-performance instance types (e.g., 2xlarge and above).
# These instance types incur significantly higher compute costs and may be unnecessary for light workloads.
# Helps detect over-provisioned resources that can be scaled down or terminated to optimize cost.
# Regular review of instance sizing ensures cost-effective usage based on workload requirements.
