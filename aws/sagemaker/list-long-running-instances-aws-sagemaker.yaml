# Identifies long-running AWS SageMaker notebook instances that have not been modified recently.
# Usually notebooks don't have to run forever
# Notebooks are designed to be started and stopped based on demand; leaving them running unnecessarily increases compute costs.
# Notebook states can be saved and started from that state whenever required
# This rule detects long running notebooks that have been running for long time
# This rule filters notebooks with a LastModifiedTime older than 1 day and in active states like Pending, InService, or Updating.
# Helps detect idle or abandoned notebooks that can be stopped to optimize cost and resource usage.
